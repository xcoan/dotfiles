# My Dotfiles
This is just a backup of my dotfiles.

The big thing here is the use of zsh instead of bash as my shell.

To install, head here: [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

The custom Dracula theme comes from here: [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/zsh/).

Even though there's a .vimrc in this repo, It's worth noting I primarily use atom
as my go-to editor.  I only use vim for small or quick things.  Large scale projects
are done in atom.
