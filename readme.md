# My Dotfiles
This is just a backup of my dotfiles.

The big thing here is the use of zsh instead of bash as my shell.

To install, head here: [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

The custom Dracula theme comes from here: [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/zsh/).

Even though there's a .vimrc in this repo, It's worth noting I primarily use atom
as my go-to editor.  Vim is only really for small edits or git stuff, so there's no magic addons or anything fun /shrug


##### Note to self (or whomever is reading through these dotfiles)
I have a gist on setting up Java junit testing on a macbook [here](https://gist.github.com/xjcoan/d57cca33f3b046acbb5b25a4bd2d6760) to get it working with my .zshrc config.
